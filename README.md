# cookieclicker

This is a modified (and combined) version of [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker) and [Universal Paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html) used for my summer camp course on cybersecurity through [Vineyard App Camp](https://www.facebook.com/vineyardappcamp/).

The only change is the addition of an integrated [JS console](https://github.com/remy/jsconsole), because student laptops have developer tools disabled.  To activate it, click the version number in the bottom left corner of the game.

This repository should not be public-facing, but students will use the [Github site](https://cubified.github.io/cookieclicker/index.html) (also for [Universal Paperclips](https://cubified.github.io/cookieclicker/paperclips/docs/index2.html)) to play the game therefore it must remain public.
